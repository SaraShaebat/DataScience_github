# BikeShare Project

This project analyzes bike share data from three cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You can filter data by city, month, and day to uncover insights and make data-driven decisions.

## How It Works
1. **Pick a city**: Choose Chicago, New York City, or Washington.
2. **Filter data**: Select a month (January to June) and day of the week, or view all data.
3. **Explore stats**: Get insights into popular times, stations, trip durations, and user demographics.

### Files used
The `.csv` files contain bikeshare data for different cities. These files are ignored in the repository using `.gitignore`.

## Features
- View raw trip data in chunks.
- Discover trends like the most common travel times and routes.
- Analyze user types, genders, and birth years (where available).

## Running the Program
1. Make sure `bikeshare.py` and the city data files (`chicago.csv`, `new_york_city.csv`, `washington.csv`) are in the same directory.
2. Run the program:
   ```
   python bikeshare.py
   ```
3. Follow the prompts to filter and analyze the data.

## Note
This project uses Python's pandas library for data analysis. The city data files must remain in `.csv` format.
